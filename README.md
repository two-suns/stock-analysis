# Stock Analysis with VBA

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Steve is happy with the workbook in its cuurent state. However, he would like to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market. The purpose of this project is to refactor the code so it loops through the data only one time to collect the same information. Then, determine if refactoring improved the run-time of the code.

## Results

### Performance Analysis
The year 2017 saw mostly positive returns on the stocks.  However, the year 2018 was much different with a majority of the stocks showing negative returns.
